      description: "Surgeries of all kinds have become more and more powerfully assisted by technology, but in most cases it’s still a human holding the scalpel — especially for delicate and complex operations like spinal surgery.Spinal deformation happens when a condition, trauma or habit causes the natural curvature of the spine to assume outsized or distorted proportions. The most frequent cause is probably scoliosis, which progressively warps the spine and if left untreated can lead to serious disability. To combat this, the spine is fitted with a custom metal frame, attached with screws, that restricts and corrects this tendency, shepherding the vertebrae into a more healthy arrangement.It’s not unlike getting braces — if teeth were sealed inside the body and there was a millimeter’s breadth between curing and paralyzing the patient. Spinal corrective surgery is commonplace (about 1.6 million of this type are performed yearly) and effective, but it’s also incredibly difficult and specialized work.Detailed interior imagery is needed for prep, but by the time they’re in the operating room, the images they have of the patient may be days or weeks old, and for acute conditions or trauma especially this is a huge problem. If the imagery doesn’t match reality, not only could something have happened in the patient’s body, but there’s an increased risk of harm working with outdated info.If the surgeon senses that the situation may have changed, the patient must be put inside an imaging machine and everyone must clear the room. Imagine doing that mid-surgery, with all that entails! Not only is it disruptive to the procedure and time-consuming, it leads to multiple radiation doses for the patient and the surgeon, who is repeatedly exposed to this process.",

      description: "When yoga first began, thousands of years ago, the only “equipment” needed was the human body and the ground.When yoga first began, thousands of years ago, the only “equipment” needed was the human body and the ground. But that began to change about 60 years ago, when B.K.S. Iyengar, developer of the style of yoga known as Iyengar, introduced many of the props we use today, says Carol Krucoff, an instructor certified by the International Association of Yoga Therapists and by Yoga Alliance, the world’s largest nonprofit yoga association that certifies teachers and schools. Krucoff is also author of the book Yoga Sparks: 108 Easy Practices for Stress Relief in a Minute or Less.The yoga mat is so ubiquitous in today’s yoga world, you may not even consider it a prop. It may seem surprising, but mats (which provide cushioning between you and the floor and help prevent slipping in various postures) are actually relatively new to the practice, when you consider that yoga began approximately 5,000 years ago. The yoga mat was the brainchild of Angela Farmer, a well-known yoga teacher, says Krucoff. Farmer started using an early version of a yoga mat herself in the late 1960s, and was marketing them by the 1980s, according to her website.“Farmer wanted something to put on the floor when she practiced so that she wouldn’t slip or slide, so she had the idea to use a rug pad — the sticky rubbery kind that you put under a rug — and the first yoga mat was born,” says Krucoff. For certain postures, like Downward-Facing Dog, a mat can be really useful to help you hold the pose, Krucoff says.",

It dropped a mere 32.2 percent to $122.2 million this weekend for a foreign tally of $423.1 million and dreamy global total of $774.5 million through Sunday as it speeds toward the $1 billion mark. It will be only the second pic of 2023 so far to join the billion-dollar box office club after Universal’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which topped out at $1.34 billion worldwide. The movie has even taken on a life of its own in China, where its cume hit $25 million through Sunday after a soft $8.2 million opening. It could leg out to $40 million, far more than anyone expected, considering Barbie isn’t doing as well in Asian markets as it is elsewhere. Among all international markets, the U.K. leads with $61.6 million, ahead of the final Harry Potter film’s first 10 days, while it is already the biggest Warners movie ever in Brazil with an early total of $33.5 million.",

Even better, the movements you do during your workouts target more than just one muscle group. Gotta love efficiency!.Speaking of efficiecy, when researchers from the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse looked at women who do CrossFit, they found that they burned 12 or more calories per minute. Their conclusion: "CrossFit works." "Based on the high intensity of the workouts tested, [we] conclude that CrossFit does a really good job of helping exercisers improve their aerobic fitness while burning a fair number of calories in the process," reads the study.The reason why comes back to the fact that the routines are heavy with compound exercises, says Tony Carvajal, a certified CrossFit trainer with RSP Nutrition.

      description: "With almost 200 countries to choose from, why should you pick Thailand as your next destination? From delicious food to Bangkok’s nightlife, here are our reasons why you should visit this popular destination in Southeast Asia at least once in your life.Travelers on a budget are constantly and regretfully having to slash cities from their itineraries due to a sheer lack of funds. This is not the case in Thailand, however, where travel is cheap and different modes of transportation are readily available. Budget-friendly airlines, like Nok Air and AirAsia, always seem to be running some type of sale on flights, with direct flights available to international and domestic airports in cities across the country. Buses and trains around the country are incredibly affordable as well, with stations in both rural cities and some of the biggest tourist destinations in Thailand.Thailand has three major seasons, all of which are suitable for vacationers to travel during and enjoy. The country is busiest during the dry season, when temperatures do not normally reach over 32C (90F). During the hot season, tourists flock to the many dreamy beaches found along Thailand’s immense coast. Bangkok and northern Thailand are popular destinations during the monsoon season, as the islands are prone to flooding during this time. Though there are pros and cons to each season, visitors are never likely to get cold and can usually enjoy plenty of the country’s sunshine during their visit.",

      description: "India, with its rich heritage and deep-rooted culture, boasts a culinary history as old as time itself. The food habits of the country are deeply rooted in traditions, shaped by centuries of invasions, religious beliefs, and social customs.One of India's most intriguing dining traditions is eating with your hands, which finds its origins in Ayurveda, the ancient system of holistic medicine. According to Vedic wisdom, each finger represents one of the five elements - space, air, fire, water, and earth. Eating with the hands is believed to stimulate these elements and aid in the release of digestive juices in the stomach. The nerve endings on the fingertips are known to play a role in enhancing digestion by making the individual more conscious of the taste, textures, and aromas of the food. This tactile connection with the meal evokes emotions and passion, creating a deeper sensory experience.The Bohri Muslim community follows a unique dining tradition of sharing a meal from one huge platter called the thal. This communal experience begins with the family sitting around the platter and passing the salt to every member for a symbolic start to the meal. The thal consists of various dishes placed at the centre, and each member pulls out their portion to ensure there are no leftovers. This practice is believed to invoke a sense of unity and moderation.",

      description: "Many people also know Mumbai as Bombay (this was the city’s official name until 1995). It’s the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra and the most densely populated city in India with a population of 18.4 million. If you ever have the opportunity to visit India, Mumbai is a place you definitely must see.India is a wonderful country which means the Mumbai isn’t the only place you have to visit. But it can be an excellent starting point to see other wonders of India. Lots of tourists are attracted to Udaipur, which is said to be India’s most romantic city with its floating palaces between two rivers. Konark is a very interesting and charming temple that dates back to the 13th century and was buried by sand and then rediscovered by the British. Of course, you can’t miss out on the famous Taj Mahal when in India, whose construction was ordered in the 17th century by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his wife, who died giving birth to their fourteenth child. Taj Mahal is protected by UNESCO, who describes it as the jewel of Islamic architecture. If you’re interested in southern India, read the travelogue by Anja Turk.Also interesting to note is the Haji Ali Dargah mosque and tomb that was built in 1431 and its construction was ordered by a rich Muslim merchant who changed his life after visiting Mecca. The Haji Ali Dargah is only accessible during low tide because it’s located out in the sea and you can only reach it through a narrow passageway. As we’ve already mentioned, Mumbai is the heart of Bollywood, the large centre of Indian film industry, and if you really want to, you can actually star in a film instead of taking a guided tour. Nothing is impossible. Judging by the number of Mumbai’s population, one probably wouldn’t imagine the city to also have a national park, but this is where Mumbai surprises again.",

In Hinduism, there are thousands of gods and goddesses, and Ganesh, the deity with elephant head is really popular. In the evening, I heard drums from far away, crackling firecrackers and loud cheers. 'Indians gone crazy',was the first thing that got to my mind when I saw this scene.South India is much greener than the central part, in addition, is a bit cleaner. But when you think that in all this dirt nothing can surprise anymore, it happens that you have to use toilete at the bus station. The signs are not required as unbearable odour is what leads you to the counter, where gentlemen charge for the use of toilet. I entered and I you just could not help myself. I screamed loudly and the young man behind the counter just calmly looked up and asked. I had no choice, so I obeyed. You meet Rats everywhere because heaps of garbage are dumped right on the street. In Kerala, in the south-west India, to the delight of tourists, garbage is removed regularly. Kerala is not only the most successful Indian country it is also one of the most beautiful. Famous Kerala backwaters, where you can cruise on a houseboat made of wood and bamboo, are simply amazing. In the silence of natural sounds the narrow backwaters of river will reveal the everyday of local people that bathe, wash laundry and fish in the river. ",

SCO and India-US 2+2 dialogues contribute to India’s external security insight. Separately, forums like BRICS underscore the perspectives of the developing world, with the objective of reforming the UN to face new global challenges. India has also begun actively engaging with the British Commonwealth, once dubbed a colonial hangover, now promoting the economic and strategic interests of its member countries. Pursuing multi-alignment through multilateral settings works to strengthen India’s security architecture, to help garner critical votes at the UNSC table, enable India to identify areas of collaboration with different countries, and raise the country’s global stature during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      description: "The Samsung foldable for most gets a much-improved external screen amid otherwise modest upgrades.At 6.7 inches, the Flip’s main display is well within the acceptable phablet realm. In fact, it’s actually 0.1 inches smaller than the Galaxy S23 Ultra. But it’s infinitely more portable than both. This particular design does, however, come with the caveat of a bizarre 22:9 aspect ratio. You’re just not going to get something more standardized without making the device substantially wider. It’s generally not an issue, so long as you’re cool dealing with some pillarboxing when watching videos.With a bit of distance, it always dawns on me how silly it is to call a $1,000 phone affordable. It’s a lot of money for most of us, and prior to the iPhone X’s debut, the notion of dipping into four digits for a handset was downright absurd. That, of course, was years before the Galaxy Fold arrived at a hair under $2,000. Scaling has brought the price down a bit, but the latest version will still run you $1,800.That’s a hard pill to swallow in a world where economic headwinds have hampered already slowing global smartphone sales. Every day people have trouble stomaching the idea of paying half that for a phone. Components are to blame. More sales = more production = a lower per unit price, so there’s a decent chance they’ll continue to lower in price — especially as the company supplies screens to the competition.",

Here is everything to know about the MCU villain. It is on the 75th-second mark that the board reading Zaniac appears in the trailer of Tom Hiddleston starrer, Loki Season 2. Thus, confirming all the theories that fans had been brewing about the Thor villain. This happened to be the poster of the movie Zaniac which was released back in the 1980s. The movie is about a parasitic entity that was sent to Earth by the ruler of the Dark Dimension, Dormammu.The creature is known to move from one host to another, only targeting men. It is said that Zaniac killed men who were misogynists and who looked down upon women. However, when the God of Thunder comes to know of these murders, he graces Earth to put a stop to his wrath. Since Zaniac originally is a Thor villain, his entry into Loki's world is all but natural. But the one thing that fans cannot seem to wrap their heads around is Thor's appearance in Loki Season 2. While there are leaker pages on Twitter that confirm Chris Hemosworth's cameo in the new season, the news has not been confirmed by Marvel or any of the castmates associated with the new season.",

Then the word ‘Tirange’ was changed to ‘Jhande’ and the ‘Har Jhande Ko…’ dialogue was suitably modified.The line in the thumri song ‘Bata De Sakhi’ was replaced by ‘Bata De Piya Kahaan Bitaayi Shaam’. A dialogue ‘Dono ek hi toh hai. Baba Nanak ne bhi yahin kaha hai’ was replaced with ‘Ek noor te sab jag upaje. Baba Nanak ne bhi yehi kaha hai’ with references to the holy Quran and Bhagavad Gita.Finally, the makers were asked to submit documentary evidence for all the stats and references made about the 1971 India-Pakistan war. Also, the makers submitted translation for the shlokas and mantras used in the film.After these changes were made, the CBFC granted a U/A certificate to Gadar 2. The length of the film, as mentioned on the certificate is 170 minutes. In other words, Gadar 2 is 2 hours 50 minutes long.Gadar 2 stars Sunny Deol, Ameesha Patel and Utkarsh Sharma and releases on August 11.",

      description: "It may only be July, but Vijay Sethupathi and Katrina Kaif are already feeling the holiday cheer (or scaries) as they unveiled two posters for their new film Merry Christmas earlier today.This announcement comes almost seven months after Vijay Sethupathi and Katrina Kaif unveiled the first teaser poster for the film which showed two hands clinking wine glasses with enough force to cause them to shatter—and when is that ever a good sign? The two posters released via social media have a quintessential vintage vibe and convey a fair bit of mystery: one shows Sethupathi and Kaif looking solemnly into the camera while elements of Mumbai (Regal cinema, a kaali peeli taxi, the CST monument) take up space in the backdrop. A lone red balloon and a man holding a teddy bear (Setupathi from the looks of it) point to some sort of romance but the red-tinged sky against it speaks to an ominous fate as does the tagline “Raat jitni sangeen hogi, subaha utni rangeen hogi (“However hard the night will be, the morning will be just as colourful”). The second poster in Tamil shows Sethupathi and Kaif, once again looking grim and bathed in a reddish hue.",

Pushpa: The Rise was released in December 2021 and since then, fans have been waiting for the sequel but there has been no update about it.Interestingly, it was Allu Arjun, the lead actor in the movie, who proposed to slow down the shooting process. He expressed his desire to see Pushpa 2 hit the screens in April 2024, instead of this year. The reason behind this decision is his belief that releasing the film during the summer vacation period will attract a larger audience and lead to higher revenue. He pointed out the success of KGF 2, which broke records when it was released in April, as an example of the strategic release date's potential.",

The Akshay Kumar starrer movie has been grabbing headlines for various reasons including the context of the film, the CBFC certification issues and whatnot. OMG 2 also courted some controversies which kept the movie in buzz.The trailer of OMG 2 begins with Lord Shiva asking Nandi to send one of his doot to help out one of his devotees. And then we see a judge reading out the complainant and defendant's name, Kranti Sharma Mudgal played by Pankaj Tripathi. The story then takes back to his son whose video is leaked on the internet which leads to his expulsion from school. The boy is brutally judged and even his father reprimands him for his behaviour. But a tragic incident leads to Kranti Sharma Mudgal filing a case against the school. He asks for strength from Mahadev in order to fight the case and that's when Akshay Kumar enters the scene. The OMG 2 trailer also has some comic elements and it has some emotional scenes as well. Yami Gautam plays a lawyer who seems to be fighting the case of the school.",

These powers include the ability to waive certain data fiduciaries, including startups, from compliance if the need arises. They can also permit the handling of children’s data, given that the fiduciary can demonstrate adequate protective measures.The legislation dictates that the central government is responsible for establishing the data protection board. The government will also appoint the members and chairperson of the board, each serving for an initial term of two years. The bill outlines that a member of the data protection board can only resign through written notice submitted to the government. This resignation comes into effect either three months after submission, upon receiving government approval or once a new successor is appointed or the existing term expires.",

      description: "Waymo plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin  — putting the company once again in direct competition with rival Cruise.The commercial expansion to Austin is a full-circle moment for Waymo. Back in 2015, the former Google self-driving project conducted its first driverless ride on public roads with a legally blind man named Steve Mahan riding solo in the prototype Firefly vehicle.Waymo returned in March 2023 to test the latest iteration of its self-driving system — known as the “fifth-generation driver” — in its modified Jaguar I-Pace vehicles. While it wasn’t a guarantee that Waymo would launch its commercial ride-hailing service in Austin — the company has tested in several cities for brief periods of time — it did hint at what was coming.Waymo typically begins with employees or contractors (called human safety operators) behind the wheel of its test vehicles. Eventually, the Waymo worker is removed and the driverless vehicles are monitored remotely. Waymo then opens its service to vetted members of the public, or “riders.” Eventually, the service, known as Waymo One, is accessible to everyone willing to pay for a ride. Today, Waymo only charges for rides in Phoenix. The company is awaiting a final permit from the California Public Utilities Commission that will allow it to charge passengers in the state. Cruise is also waiting for the same permit.",

Last October, Xiaomi wound down its financial services business in the country including a loan app called Mi Credit. At the same time, the company stopped offering its cloud backup service globally. The phone maker also discontinued its short video app Zilli earlier this year. Additionally, the Indian government banned Xiaomi’s browser, video call and community app along with a swathe of Chinese apps including TikTok, Shein and UC Browser in 2020. Xiaomi has faced a challenging time in India amid a regulatory crackdown over tax evasion issues and an executive exodus. Last year, the company’s long-time top exec Manu Kumar Jain — who oversaw Xiaomi’s growth in India from the start — left the company.

The Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency has announced it’s suing the social media platform over what it calls a “clear refusal” to enter into discussions with it about remuneration for the sharing of its news content on X.The extension to EU copyright law covers article extracts and all but the shortest snippets of news content, which are shared on digital platforms. It isn’t limited to text either — also covering other content produced by news publishers, such as photographs, videos and infographics. News publishers’ content is covered for two years after its publication date.The extension of copyright law to cover excerpts of news content being reshared on digital platforms was agreed by the European Union back in 2019 and transposed into French law in July of the same year. But apparently Musk never got the memo. (Tbh, he was probably a bit more focused on building electric cars, firing rockets into space, digging big holes in the ground and trolling people on Twitter back then . . .)",

The kit caters to fintechs and financial service providers interested in experimenting with solutions and business models based on digital currencies pioneered by central banks.The New York-based business is today announcing a $4 million seed investment led by Matrix Partners India. It plans to further the development of this CBDC stack and that of its regtech solution. BTN.vc, VestedWorld, Equity Alliance, LoftyInc Capital, Level Up Ventures and Collide Capital are some of the other investors in the round. They join Emtech’s previous investors, including Noemis Ventures, Octerra Capital and 500 Global on its cap table. This round brings the four-year-old’s total investment to $10 million (including a $4 million pre-seed last year and a recent $2 million extension).The CBDC Innovation Kit’s unveiling in July comes as no surprise. Last March, founder Carmelle Cadet said Emtech would deploy its first version of a CBDC platform this year. Emtech’s digital regulatory platform previously included the innovator’s center, which assists fintechs in preparing and testing requirements for numerous regulators and pre-market technological integration.

      description: "India restricted import of laptops, tablets, other personal computers and servers with immediate effect on Thursday, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in an amendment, saying it will impose a licensing requirement for imports in a move that analysts say appears to be aimed at boosting the local manufacturing efforts.In May, the Narendra Modi government unveiled a $2 billion scheme aimed at promoting businesses locally building hardware like laptops, PCs, servers and related edge computing kits. The scheme was an upgrade to the previous program under which the government was willing to spend $892 million.Dell and HP are among the companies that already have manufacturing facilities in India. The Indian government also aims to expand local production further and make the country a desirable location for Apple and its manufacturing partners to establish a global manufacturing hub. However, the country currently spends billions of dollars on importing laptops and other hardware.According to the government data shared in the parliament in December, the import value of finished electronic goods in India grew 32% to $43 billion in 2021–2022 from over $32 billion in 2019–2020. However, the incentives and schemes offered to boost local production helped drop the share of imported finished electronic goods (including components) in total imports of electronic goods to 64% in 2021–22, down from 69% in 2019–2020.",

Anurag Sen, a good-faith security researcher known for discovering inadvertently exposed data on the internet, found the database and shared details with TechCrunch to alert the company. According to Sen, the database was exposed to the internet without a password, allowing anyone to access the sensitive data inside using a web browser, just with its IP address. TechCrunch found that the database was also accessible from an easily guessable subdomain of a Mondee subsidiary’s website. The database, hosted on Oracle’s cloud and more than 1.7 terabytes in size at the time it was exposed, contained customer’s personal information, including names, gender, dates of birth, home addresses, flight information and passport numbers. Some of the data seen by TechCrunch includes full customer passenger name records, or PNR, including ticket and booking details. TechCrunch has also seen customers’ full credit card numbers and expiry dates in the database, but none of the data was encrypted.TechCrunch verified that the exposed data matches real people’s information. One person we spoke to confirmed their flight information was accurate and said they booked their flights through a popular booking site.",

      description: "Xpeng, a prominent Chinese electric vehicle maker and a competitor to Tesla, has announced the resignation of its vice president of autonomous driving, Xinzhou Wu, over personal and family reasons. Wu, formerly a senior director of engineering at Qualcomm where he spent over a decade, was effectively the head of Xpeng’s autonomous driving business and played a pivotal role in helping Xpeng gain an edge over its EV rivals in the intelligent driving race. The NYSE-listed EV upstart is recognized for its in-house, full-stack development team responsible for creating the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) Xpeng Navigation Guided Pilot (XNPG), which is considered a counterpart to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system.In March, Xpeng upgraded its city navigation system for customers in first-tier cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shanghai. In a few months, the system’s mileage penetration rate had exceeded 60%, Xpeng revealed on a recent earnings call. Moreover, the company aims to reduce the number of manual takeovers per 1,000 kilometers when using its highway navigation to one or fewer by the end of 2023.Tesla hasn’t made FSD available in China yet and recently denied rumors that it would introduce the option in Shanghai soon. Even if it had plans to do so, it would take the American giant at least 12 months to localize the system for China’s complex road conditions, Wu said in a previous interview.",

      description: "Cruella is Disney's latest efforts to reintroduce old characters, and contemporise them for the new, younger generation of moviegoers. It's not a memorable one, that's for sure.Cruella, directed by Craig Gillespie, is the origin story of the skunk-haired classic Disney villainess from 101 Dalmations, played by Glenn Close (who is credited as executive producer). Close as Cruella De Vil was hammy, incredibly terrifying, and delightfully diabolical. The character was faithful to the original animated film, unlike this one that takes some revisionist liberties, tries to take the bitter edge off of Cruella by humanising her, and directs the audience to the reasons why she switched to the dark side.The story begins with a flashback. We meet a young Estella (Tipper Seifert-Cleveland), who dreams of making it big as a fashion designer. As a child, she always stands out in the crowd, because of her differently coloured hair and bullish, outspoken nature. Estella is often bullied, but never buckles down to the horrible kids who just couldn't get themselves to accept her.",

Right from a haunting BGM, impeccable camerawork, emotional drama and twists with the superb combination of cerebral stuff and gripping, however, it gives you the experience of a non-Nolan affair. The historical psychodrama has a mesmerising first half, which includes Oppenheimer’s encounter with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) at Princeton, his marriage to alcoholic Kitty (Emily Blunt) and other key incidents. But the second half surpasses your expectations, where we see the testing of the Atomic bomb, the World War II situation, Hiroshima & Nagasaki’s bombing effects and Oppenheimer being accused of the threat and questioning his loyalty to the United States of America.",

      description: "Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is still some days away from its date with the global box office on June 2, though fans in India are already excited having watched the initial teaser. The trailer introduces to big screen the character of Pavitr Prabhakar, or Spider-Man India, who lives in Mumbattan city in an alternate universe. While the animated film’s core plot will concentrate on Miles Morales, the Black Spider-Man, and his new adventure across the multiverse, Pavitr’s funny jab in the trailer at Miles over ‘chai’ and at Mumbai’s famed traffic woes are winning desi fans over. A Brown Spider- Man from another universe playing a cameo in a film that stars Spider - Man as a Black teenager takes Hollywood inclusivity to the next level.This is, after all, the second time Miles gets into the Spider suit, after 2018’s Spider - Man: Into The Spider - Verse.The new sequel, however, raises the stakes a lot higher.The film’s director trio of Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K.Thompson has substantially widened the scope and challenge for their Black superhero this time, taking the new adventure across several parallel universes, as Miles along with Gwen Stacy as Spider - Woman comes across a new team of Spider - People known as the Spider - Society.",

If you have an autoimmune disease, check with your doctor first, as water temperature may be a factor, Ruest says. And if you’ve recently had surgery, get clearance from your doctor first. The International Fitness Association also recommends that people with compromised respiratory functions, severe low blood pressure, bladder or vaginal infections, any infectious diseases, chlorination allergies and open or unhealed wounds avoid aqua workouts.",

      description: "Your oblique muscles play an important role in good body posture, balance, and coordination. The right exercises will help you keep them strong.Props are tools that provide support. If and when a prop serves such a purpose, it can be a key part of a yoga practice, Krucoff says. Props aren’t just for beginners or for people who can’t do certain poses; they are useful tools whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned yogi, she says.Typically, you don’t have to spend a lot of money on props — you can often use something you might have around the house rather than purchasing a special strap or a blanket — but getting a nice yoga mat is a good investment if you’re planning on continuing your practice, Krucoff says. Poorer quality mats can hold on to smells and degrade quickly, she says. “You can expect a good yoga mat to last 20 years or longer,” she says.In some restorative classes, you might use the strap to gently tie your legs together in some poses, such as when you are lying on the floor and have your legs up the wall, to help you fully relax, says Krucoff. “The strap can help you access and hold poses that you might not otherwise be able to do,” she says.In some restorative classes, you might use the strap to gently tie your legs together in some poses, such as when you are lying on the floor and have your legs up the wall, to help you fully relax, says Krucoff. “The strap can help you access and hold poses that you might not otherwise be able to do,” she says.",

      description: "When yoga first began, thousands of years ago, the only “equipment” needed was the human body and the ground.Sitting on the floor often can lead to poor posture because most people just aren’t used to it, says Krucoff. “Sitting on the edge of a chair can help you sit up tall while you do different poses and can help build strength in the core of the body.”“A single block can be used for strengthening or keeping you in a pose,” she says. For example, you could hold a block between your thighs for some poses (such as chair pose) to keep your knees from splaying out, she says. In this case, you’ll need to keep your thighs in proper alignment to keep the block from falling. Blocks can also be used to help you access a pose by bringing the floor “closer to you,” says Krucoff. For example, in a lunge, her hands don’t comfortably reach the floor, she says. “My back would have to be rounded, which is not what you want in this pose,” she says.By placing a block under each hand, she can keep a long spine and do the pose properly, she says.By propping up different parts of your body, blocks can also help you reach a fuller stretch in your chest or hips. Using a block may allow you to experience a pose in a new, deeper, or more intense way.",

And there’s also a growing body of science showing that a regular yoga practice may benefit people with a host of chronic health conditions, including asthma, heart disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS). That literature is not as established as the practice of yoga itself, but a lot of work has been done. Here’s what we know.Exercise boosts energy and mood, and yoga is no exception. Many who practice yoga do so for its benefits in terms of relaxation and stress management. (1) Research from 2022 shows that yoga, as well as mindfulness, is associated with reductions in perceived levels of stress. Additionally, research has shown yoga interventions are linked to improved objective measures of stress levels in the body, like reduced evening cortisol levels, reduced waking cortisol levels, and lower resting heart rate.Yoga can yield emotional health benefits because it’s an exercise that works both the body and the mind, says Manuela Kogon, MD, a clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford Medicine and an internal medicine doctor at the Stanford Center for Integrative Medicine in Palo Alto, California.",

      description: "Sleep apnea can increase your odds of developing a wide array of health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression.Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which the muscles in the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open during sleep, causing repeated pauses in breathing that last for at least 10 seconds, according to the Sleep Foundation. When this happens, your brain wakes you up briefly to reopen your airway, and this repeated pattern of sleep interruption, which can occur as many as 30 times or more in an hour, can limit your ability to get the deep, restful sleep you need.Adequate sleep means quality sleep, not just quantity, says Raj Dasgupta, MD, a pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine specialist at Keck Medicine of USC in Los Angeles. “Someone may be getting seven to eight hours of sleep but still feel tired because they’re not going into deep sleep,” says Dr. Dasgupta. “We all need deep sleep to rejuvenate.”",

In some cases, the intense spotlight and constant scrutiny can take a toll on an individual's mental well-being. Naps come in all shapes and sizes. “Some people take restorative daytime naps in order to compensate for insufficient nighttime sleep,” says Shanon Makekau, MD, a pulmonologist and medical director of the Sleep Laboratory at Kaiser Permanente in Honolulu. “Others may take ‘prophylactic’ naps to prepare for an overnight shift.” Sticking to the shorter time frame keeps the body from dealing with sleep inertia so you wake up feeling recovered rather than sleepy. “With a power nap, you stay in the lighter stages of sleep,” Khan says. “When you’ve been sleeping longer than 30 minutes, it’s more difficult to wake up and you wake up feeling groggy versus when waking up from lighter sleep.”The main benefit of a power nap is to help you feel refreshed, so you feel more awake through the rest of the day. “When you take a power nap, it energizes you and makes you more alert for the next four to six hours,” Khan says. “You feel like you can get a lot more accomplished.”",

      description:"“Crash diets require you to skip some of your main meals, significantly limiting your calorie intake throughout the day,” says Paurana. “People on crash diets consume just a quarter of the recommended daily calorie intake while reducing their regular calorie consumption by more than half. For instance, if you require 2,000 calories per day, the average person on a crash diet only consumes around 600–700.”In addition, the exclusion of certain food groups results in inadequate nutrition that can eventually lead to deficiencies.“Rather than making you healthy and fit, crash diets steer you in the opposite direction,” says Gauri Murthy, a wellness and sports nutrition specialist from Mumbai. “When the body does not receive proper nutrients, there’s a loss of lean tissue [which breaks down easily] and muscle mass, not the fat components themselves. This can cause water loss in the body, resulting in weakness along with low energy and stamina levels. Also, because you are losing muscle mass rather than fat, your skin may sag, and your body may lack definition and appear unhealthy.”",

At the same time, the rugged terrain, clubbed with long, steep climbs, tests your physical and mental fortitude. Being physically and mentally prepared for a trek while understanding and carrying the hiking essentials will ensure that your uphill adventure leads to a high and not a downward slide.To start with, do your research. Look at factors such as the difficulty level, climate, terrain and duration of the expedition to ensure it matches your fitness level. Be mentally prepared for the challenges ahead and contingencies as well as emergencies that may arise.“If you are going for an easy trek lasting three to four hours, you do not need to be very fit. If you can walk for 30 minutes continuously, it’s enough,” says Ayaan Khan, trek lead at Plan the Unplanned. “However, if you’re doing a continuous 10–12-hour trek, it is advised that you should be able to jog five kilometres in 40 minutes.” ",

      description: "The top 10 food related tweets by users in the US contain just one item - chicken - which can qualify as healthy, according to a new study.The seventh,chicken, was the only one considered as healthy food.However, the real insights came after cross-referencing the two types of food tweets with information about the neighbourhoods they came from, including census data and health surveys.They found, for instance, that tweets from poor neighbourhoods, and regions with large households, were less likely to mention healthy foods. Also, people in areas dense with fast food restaurants tweeted more often about fast food.Twitter has already been used to track health by gauging the prevalence of smoking and finding the source of outbreaks.The difference here is that these types of comparisons could provide clues as to how our surrounding neighbourhood - the environment that we live, work and play in - impacts our health and well-being, researchers said.Our data could be telling us that certain neighbourhoods have fewer resources to support healthy diets,said Quynh Nguyen, an assistant professor at the University of Utah College of Health.She explained that perhaps neighbourhoods laden with fast food restaurants could benefit from having more supermarkets or farm stands that sell fresh produce.The top 10 tweeted foods were: 1. coffee, 2. beer, 3. pizza, 4. Starbucks, 5. IPA (beer), 6. wine, 7. chicken, 8. bbq, 9. ice cream and 10. taco/tacos.There is evidence that tweets are more than just small talk. Some types track with a community's health. Areas with more chatter about walking, dancing, running and other physical activities had fewer deaths and lower rates of obesity, researchers said.Positive sentiments towards healthy foods were also broadly related to fewer deaths and lower rates of chronic health conditions, they said.The study was published in the journal JMIR Public Health and Surveillance.",

Here are 10 ambitious recent heist.In 2009, a man and woman in New Zealand were arrested after being caught with boxes containing 20 1kg blocks of vacuum-packed cheddar, stolen that morning from a train. As the police chased the couple, cheese was flung out of the vehicle on to the road, in what will probably go down as one of the more bizarre car chases in history. It is said that cheese is the most stolen food type. One report in 2011 went so far as to label the product 'high risk' after finding £4.9m of it was stolen in the UK that year alone. It is a problem in the US as well. This March, a man was caught driving an 18-wheel truck loaded with $200,000 worth of stolen muenster cheese from Wisconsin.

Food delivery applications have become an integral part of our daily lives, providing convenience and comfort for those returning home after a tiring day. However, imagine the thrill of receiving your food order not from a delivery agent on a bike but from a drone. Recently, a viral video on Instagram showcased just that – a food delivery done by a drone. Sohan Rai, a tech content creator, took on the role of a food delivery agent for Zomato for a day, but with a futuristic twist. Observing how traditional delivery agents often grapple with traffic jams and difficulties finding addresses, Sohan saw an opportunity to utilise his expertise in drones to revolutionise food delivery. He embarked on a mission to build his own autonomous drone, designed to fly without a pilot. It was an ambitious project that required multiple iterations and repairs, but Sohan was determined to make it work.In the caption of this post, Sohan wrote, “Being a huge enthusiast of drones, I wanted to put my skills into use and build an autonomous drone which could deliver a pizza directly to a home, without having a pilot. Here, I have built the drone with a lot of Jugaad, and it would be a lot better when it is commercial.” Take a look at the video below:",

Once you try it, you'll want to make it again and again.South Indian cuisine is all about love, especially dosa. There is something comforting about this dish that honestly soothes our souls. But apart from that, when crispy dosa is dipped in flavourful sambar, it makes our tummies do the happy dance with just one bite. Now, a normal dosa is prepared with three parts rice to one part urad dal, which means we get more carbs than protein. This deprives people on a weight loss diet from enjoying this lip-smacking dish. But how would you react if we told you that now dosa can help you 'lose weight'? Nutritionist Jonna Priyanka has dropped a clip of a special recipe for bottle gourd dosa. In the video, she demonstrates how to make this healthy version of dosa.She shared the clip along with a detailed note that read,Can we eat dosa when trying to lose weight? When it comes to diet, the first thing that comes to mind is that carbohydrates should be avoided. Well, the half-truth is always dangerous. The fact is, when eaten in the right portions, it helps in losing weight and improving health. Now, our normal dosa is basically made with 3 parts rice to 1 part urad dal, which means it has less protein and more carbs.'",
