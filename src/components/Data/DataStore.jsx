Talking about his new offering Oppenheimer, it narrates the magnificent tragic story of the American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (who is known as the ‘father of the atomic bomb’). Honestly, Oppenheimer has all the elements, which you expect from a Nolan film. Right from a haunting BGM, impeccable camerawork, emotional drama and twists with the superb combination of cerebral stuff and gripping, however, it gives you the experience of a non-Nolan affair.",

      description: "Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is still some days away from its date with the global box office on June 2, though fans in India are already excited having watched the initial teaser. The trailer introduces to big screen the character of Pavitr Prabhakar, or Spider-Man India, who lives in Mumbattan city in an alternate universe. While the animated film’s core plot will concentrate on Miles Morales, the Black Spider-Man, and his new adventure across the multiverse, Pavitr’s funny jab in the trailer at Miles over ‘chai’ and at Mumbai’s famed traffic woes are winning desi fans over. A Brown Spider- Man from another universe playing a cameo in a film that stars Spider - Man as a Black teenager takes Hollywood inclusivity to the next level.This is, after all, the second time Miles gets into the Spider suit, after 2018’s Spider - Man: Into The Spider - Verse.The new sequel, however, raises the stakes a lot higher.The film’s director trio of Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K.Thompson has substantially widened the scope and challenge for their Black superhero this time, taking the new adventure across several parallel universes, as Miles along with Gwen Stacy as Spider - Woman comes across a new team of Spider - People known as the Spider - Society.",

As per reports a royal commentators believe all is not well in the Sussexs’ marriage.Eagle - eyed observers say the couple did not release a family photograph on Christmas and Harry was seen promoting his book “Spare” without Meghan by his side earlier this year. They think no acknowledgment of their five- year wedding anniversary, Harry’s solo appearance at the coronation of King Charles and Meghan’s solo brand relaunch with WME are enough of evidence to corroborate their claims that the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is on the rocks.",

When you bite into a plate of chaat, tikki, gol gappa and other dishes, we guarantee you'll be hit with a wave of flavours ranging from sweet and spicy to tangy. While some elements of your street food may dissolve quickly in your mouth, others may be crunchy. Whatever the texture is, it will undoubtedly be delectable. The best part, though? Every city in India has something special to offer. Similar to how diverse the nation is, so is the food. For instance, Mumbai is known for vada pav, Delhi for samosa and Kolkata for kathi rolls. If you are someone who loves to try different cuisines, trying out local cuisine should be on top of your radar. In fact, no tour is ever complete without indulging in the authentic street-style delicacies the city has to offer. Whether grilled over an open flame, deep-fried or eaten cold, streetside nooks and stalls are surrounded by swarms of people eating lip-smacking food.",
